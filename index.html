                  Hi! I'm Esme, a techy software developer and CompSci/HCI
                  graduate. I have a bunch of scattered computer-y projects
                  which have a loose front-end correlation. This isn't too
                  surprising as I have
                  <a href="#accessibility">several visual quirks</a>
                  so front-end accessibility is both fun and personally useful
                  to practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In general, my
                  <a href="#projects">concoctions</a>
                  usually have at least one overly specific, fun and/or
                  ridiculous feature that has no right existing but does anyway.
                  See the above 'terminal'* output (if you are able and your
                  <a href="#no-javascript">browser supports it</a>
                  :p). Depending on how long it's been since I've "finished"
                  this webspace (like all my concoctions, it will never truly be
                  finished), it will probably have many of these silly features.
                  This is my playground for all things chaotic; please, enjoy
                  your stay xD

                  is frustratingly difficult on a budget. Domestic IP addresses
                  aren't static anymore and the scripts I had to detect and
                  update the DNS became too fragile for me to maintain)

                      This project exists because I wanted to play the
                      randomizer without needing to either rely on my memory or
                      sit at my desk. It's not a perfect solution (requiring an
                      Internet connection) but it suits my needs better than the
                      alternatives. I might even get to use it casually one day~

                      Lifelogging is the process of recording one's daily life
                      as a comprehensive dataset of activity. This is typically
                      done with video cameras.

                      launcher for Linux written in Python and BASH. It matches

                      I wrote this project in 2017 and there is a <i>lot</i>
                      that I would change now. Despite that, I still have a soft
                      spot in my heart for this project. It uses a custom
                      algorithm to map the hours of the day on to a set of 24
                      discrete items for statistical analysis. There's something
                      about spending hours manipulating sets using a wipeboard
                      on my bedroom wall that <i>really</i> excited my neurons.

                  I was born (and still live) in the UK. For half of the year, I
                  get to live in the objectively* best timezone: GMT (and it's
                  evil twin BST) ;p

                  Unfortunately, the clacks haven't found there way to my neck
                  of the woods yet. As a result, please consult the next section
                  for alternatives.

                  For a relatively simple website like this, there is no reason
                  why it couldn't be created using only HTML and CSS. Not only
                  that, it creates a fun challenge to see what silly things I
                  can create under this restriction!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Philosophically speaking, I think that JavaScript is over used
                  in places where it shouldn't be. As a reasonably privacy and
                  security conscious person, I don't have JavaScript enable by
                  default on my web browsers. <i>So</i> many websites simply
                  load a blank page if JavaScript isn't an option - making them
                  completely inaccessible in these cases. This bothers me
                  (perhaps more than it should) so I decided to skip out on
                  using it for my webspace.

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                  For most people, accessibility is that section in the settings
                  menu that has a bunch of weird and strange toggles, dials and
                  sliders. Oh, and it has the dark mode toggle hidden in there
                  for some reason /s. For me, it's a treasure trove of fun and
                  useful features that enhance and improve computer devices.

                  I've needed glasses since before I was in school. I have an
                  astigmatism and I'm colour deficient (nothing too fun - just
                  deuteranopia). No, you can't try on my glasses but I'll talk to
                  you for ages about cool eye stuff.
