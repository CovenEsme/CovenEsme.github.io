                Hi! I'm Esme, a techy software developer and CompSci/HCI
                graduate. I have a bunch of scattered computer-y projects
                across the tech stack. User-facing projects are my bread
                and butter with a particular passion towards accessibility.
                I have some <a href="#accessibility">visual quirks</a> which
                makes this personally meaningful.
              </p>
              <p>
                In general, my <a href="#projects">concoctions</a> usually have
                at least one overly specific, fun and/or ridiculous feature
                that has no right existing but does anyway. See the above
                'terminal' output (if you are able and your
                <a href="#no-javascript">browser supports it</a> :p). I like to
                go the extra mile to incorporate fun and silly things into my
                personal projects. For intstance, this website has many easter
                eggs! This is my playground for all things chaotic; please,
                enjoy your stay xD

                    A randomizer for The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD. I
                    have poured my efforts into this project for a year after
                    working on the Wii version for even longer. Skyward Sword
                    means a lot to me from my childhood and learning to mod the
                    game has been hugely rewarding. It has helped me through
                    many tough times and has allowed me to hone many
                    development skills.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This project has been my most technically challenging so
                    far. It has truly proven (at least to myself) my abilities
                    as a "full-stack" dev. From the lowest level 64bit ARM
                    assembly to the highest level GUI design to the even higher
                    level of human interaction, I have been at the front of it
                    all.

                    This project exists because I wanted to play the
                    randomizer without needing to either rely on my memory or
                    sit at my desk. It's not a perfect solution (requiring an
                    Internet connection) but it suits my needs better than the
                    alternatives. I might even get to use it casually one day~

                    Lifelogging is the process of recording one's daily life
                    as a comprehensive dataset of activity. This is typically
                    done with video cameras.

                    SPICA is an experimental H3D tool written in C# by
                    <a href="https://github.com/gdkchan">gdkchan</a>.
                    Specifically, this is a fork of a fork of that original
                    project. This version is meant to be used for handling the
                    BCH files that ALBW uses for it's assets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently, it is not feature complete in a way that allows
                    for model editing (the main goal of the project). At some
                    point in the future, I may add a webpage here describing
                    the key parts of the project that need to be modified or
                    implemented in order for this tool to be useful for the
                    ALBW modding community.

                    I.A.N. (or Project I.A.N.) is a predictive application
                    launcher for Linux written in Python and BASH. It matches
                    app launch frequency with the hour of launch by using
                    mathematical sets.

                    I wrote this project in 2017 and there is a <i>lot</i>
                    that I would change now. Despite that, I still have a soft
                    spot in my heart for this project. It uses a custom
                    algorithm to map the hours of the day on to a set of 24
                    discrete items for statistical analysis. There's something
                    about spending hours manipulating sets using a wipeboard
                    on my bedroom wall that <i>really</i> excited my neurons.

                    I wouldn't recommend anyone actually try using this
                    application but I like it enough to keep it around after
                    all these years.

              <p>
                For a relatively simple website like this, there is no reason
                why it couldn't be created using only HTML and CSS. Not only
                that, it creates a fun challenge to see what silly things I
                can create under this restriction!
              </p>
              <p>
                Philosophically speaking, I think that JavaScript is over used
                in places where it shouldn't be. As a reasonably privacy and
                security conscious person, I don't have JavaScript enable by
                default on my web browsers. <i>So</i> many websites simply
                load a blank page if JavaScript isn't an option - making them
                completely inaccessible in these cases. This bothers me
                (perhaps more than it should) so I decided to skip out on
                using it for my webspace.

              <h3>Accessibility</h3>
              <p>
                For most people, accessibility is that section in the settings
                menu that has a bunch of weird and strange toggles, dials and
                sliders. Oh, and it has the dark mode toggle hidden in there
                for some reason /s. For me, it's a treasure trove of fun and
                useful features that enhance and improve computer devices.

                I've needed glasses since before I was in school. I have an
                astigmatism and I'm colour deficient (nothing too fun - just
                deuteranopia). No, you can't try on my glasses but I'll talk to
                you for ages about cool eye stuff.
